          <h1>Q/A</h1>

          <p>What does ICQ stand for? Important Child Quality.</p>

          <p>What does IIL stand for? Important in Life.</p>

          <p>What does the color of the bubble indicate? Continent.</p>

          <p>What does the bubble radius indicate? GDP per capita.</p>

          <p>
            What is the difference of “Cluster” and “Continent”? Cluster just
            create a random cluster of all countries, continents create a
            cluster of countries per continent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Can I filter data? Yes, use the parallel coordinates to filter ICQ
            and IIL variables. To filter on GDP you have to click on the
            bubbles.
          </p>

          <p>Why can I move the bubbles? Because it is fun.</p>

          <p>
            Why cant I always click on a country? It is the force animation that
            needs to render before you click it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Why does some countries get stuck when I categorize on Continent?
            Becuase force simulation is based on radius, you can help them out
            by draging them with your mouse!

          <h1>Discovery process 1</h1>
          <p>
            I am amazed by the extent of which the World Values Survey (WVS)
            organization have gathered data for the last four decades. When
            going through the available data I found some interesting variables
            that I wanted to dig deeper into, important child qualities (ICQ).
          </p>
          <img src="images/icq.png" />

          <p>
            The ICQ variables is a measure of how important a certain quality is
            for a child to have. I began to search for relationships between ICQ
            variables and other variables such as important in life (IIL)
            variables. One example is the picture below which show how countries
            value childrens faith and cross it with how countries value religion
            overall.
          </p>
          <img src="images/cross.png" />

          <p>
            Many problems arose during this discovery process, it was very hard
            to get an understanding of the data in the format that it was
            displayed. Also variables where grouped as either important or not
            important, some were grouped in more detailed categories such as
            very-, rather-, not very-, not at all- important. To get a deeper
            understanding of what child qualities countries value I decided to
            aggregate data from both WVS and Gapminder. In order to understand
            the data I decided to create an interactive tool.

          <p>
            To gain a deeper understanding of what qualities countries value in
            their children and what might affect those values I decided to
            create my own tool and aggregate data which I thought to have
            interesting relationships. Questions that I was interested in was
            how Important Child Qualities (ICQ) variables was related to
            Important In Life (IIL) varibles, are there any double standards?
            Does geographical location matter? How does GDP per capita affect
            ICQ variables? And does the importance of these values change over
            time?
          </p>

          <img src="images/hardwork.png" />
          <p>
            I had a thesis that countries that value hard working children would
            have a lower GDP per capita since everyone in the family have to
            help. In richer countries this type of quality is not as important.
            Looking at the picture above we can see that there might be
            something to that thesis, it is ofcourse important to remember that
            it might not be the case since there can be more important factors
            that affect this variable. There are many interesting findings one
            can do with this tool, see for yourself!

        <h1>Result</h1>
        <p>
          The result is a tool that visualize Important Child Qualities-,
          Important In Life, GDP per capita-, Geographic location- variables all
          at once. It display all countries available from the World Values
          Survey organization between the years 1995-2014. The total amount of
          variables displayed are 16, the data is gathered from World Values
          Survey organization and Gapminder.
        </p>

        <p>
          At first I was thinking of a map to display all countries, but I later
          realized that it is not very meaningful to get the exact location of
          the country, or its boundaries. Displaying countries as bubbles gave
          me the opportunity to use the radius as an additional dimension while
          keeping some geographical information by grouping bubbles by
          continent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently the color of the bubble show the continent, this information
          is a bit unnecessary since the possibility to group by continent is
          available. What I would like to do is to change meaning of the color
          so that it reflects to the official religion of the country. It would
          be interesting to see how that affect ICQ variables.
